                Day. I became the proud owner of Daisy.</p>

            <p class="description">She has been on a number of adventures around the country with my husband and I
                already. My friends (who think I'm ever so slightly potty) can't wait for the latest photos and updates.

            <p class="description">It was on one of our trips that I realised there were many lonely teddy bears waiting
                for their forever home and big adventure. All my rescued bears have been lovingly washed, groomed and
                dressed. </p>
            <p class="description">And so my quest begins...</p>
            <p class="description">It would be lovely to see my rescued bears in their new home. please feel free to
                post a photo to my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Justforyouatamandasemporium/">Facebook page</a>.

            <p class="description">My bears have been rescued and rehomed all over the UK (some even rehomed abroad)!
