            <p class="description">Welcome and thanks for stopping by…</p>
            <p class="description">Many years ago I turned my passion for crafting into a small business, to share my love of crochet and sewing
                with others. I can’t imagine sitting down at home in the evening without picking up my hooks to crochet
                a blanket or two. This simple hobby brings me lots of joy. I always carry odd balls of wool and my hooks
                to events, as I am often asked how to start a blanket, and of course I am only too happy to oblige. My
                lovely Mum, Pat, is an avid knitter and all my beautiful cardigans and teddy bear onesies' are down to her.</p>
            <p class="description">My stock is always changing and no two items are ever really the same. Check out my Gallery page for a selection
                of my creations. I am always trying out new ideas and designs.</p>
            <p class="description">I would love to meet you……</p>
