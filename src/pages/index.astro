    subText="Many years ago I turned my passion for crafting into a small business, to share my love of crochet and sewing with others. I can't imagine sitting down at home in the evening without picking up my hooks to crochet a blanket or two. This simple hobby brings me lots of joy. I always carry odd balls of wool and my hooks to events, as I am often asked how to start a blanket, and of course I am only too happy to oblige. My lovely Mum, Pat, is an avid knitter and all my beautiful cardigans and teddy bear onesies are down to her."
